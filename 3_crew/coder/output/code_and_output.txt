The Python code used to calculate the first 100 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and the total multiplied by 4 is as follows:

```python
# Python program to calculate the first 100 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the total by 4

def calculate_series(n_terms):
    total = 0
    for n in range(n_terms):
        if n % 2 == 0:  # even index: add
            total += 1 / (2 * n + 1)
        else:           # odd index: subtract
            total -= 1 / (2 * n + 1)
    return total

# Calculate the first 100 terms 
terms = 100
result = calculate_series(terms) * 4
print(result)
```

The output of the code is: `3.1315929035585537`.
